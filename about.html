      <p class="muted">
        My name is Caleb, and I’m a web developer and entrepreneur from Ohio. My life has involved a lot of moving across
        Northwest Ohio, which taught me adaptability, resilience, and how to connect with people in new environments.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        My education followed a winding path too — different schools, different towns, and constant adjustment. A major turning
        point came when I enrolled at Penta Career Center. I explored business first, then construction trades, but I eventually
        found my place in Information Technology. The problem-solving, logic, and creative potential of tech clicked for me.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        In IT, I found a way to turn my long-time interest in building systems (and the creativity I enjoyed in simulation games)
        into real skills. I pushed myself, earned certifications, and later chose to focus more on cybersecurity — learning not only
        how to build digital infrastructure, but how to protect it.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        I also live with ADHD, hydrocephalus, anxiety, PTSD, and an intellectual disability. Navigating life with these challenges
        shaped how I see the world — it built patience, perseverance, and empathy, and it’s one reason I care so much about inclusion.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        That motivation is the heart behind one of my proudest accomplishments: founding Caleb’s Merch Store. I launched it as a mission-driven
        business designed to support, celebrate, and raise awareness for people with disabilities. It’s a way to turn personal experience into
        something that helps other people feel seen and supported.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        Today, I’m focused on building web projects, improving my skills, and growing my business with a purpose — combining digital creation,
        entrepreneurship, and community connection.
